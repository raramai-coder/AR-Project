# Project Overview
AR-Project is a prototype or application designed to explore and implement Augmented Reality functionalities. The goal of this project is to create immersive AR experiences that can be used for education, entertainment, or other innovative purposes. Specific features or objectives (e.g., AR object placement, real-world interaction, etc.) are implemented using relevant AR frameworks and tools.

*Note: If you are looking for detailed project goals or specific features, they will be updated as the project evolves. Currently, this repository serves as a foundation for AR experimentation.*

## Technologies Used
Unity: For building the AR application and integrating 3D models.
AR Foundation: Unity's framework for creating cross-platform AR experiences.
ARCore/ARKit: For Android and iOS AR capabilities.
C#: Primary programming language for scripting in Unity.
Other Tools: (Add additional libraries, SDKs, or tools as applicable).

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites
Unity Editor (version 2020.3 or later recommended)
A device supporting AR (Android with ARCore or iOS with ARKit)
Git (for cloning the repository)
A compatible IDE for C# (e.g., Visual Studio)

### Steps
1. Clone the Repository
2. Launch Unity Hub.
3. Click on "Add" and select the cloned AR-Project folder.
4. Open the project in the appropriate Unity Editor version.
5. Install Dependencies:
- Ensure AR Foundation, ARCore, and ARKit packages are installed via Unity’s Package Manager.
- Resolve any additional dependencies listed in the project (if applicable).
6. Build and Run:
Connect your AR-supported device via USB.
In Unity, go to File > Build Settings and select your platform (Android/iOS).
Build and deploy the application to your device.
7. Launch the application on your AR-supported device.
8. Follow on-screen instructions to enable AR features (e.g., point the camera at a flat surface to detect planes).
9. Interact with the AR elements as implemented (specific interactions to be detailed as the project develops).

## Contributing
We welcome contributions to improve and expand the AR-Project! Here’s how you can get involved:

Fork the Repository: Create your own fork of the project.
Clone Locally: Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
Make Changes: Implement your features, bug fixes, or enhancements.
Test: Ensure your changes work as expected in Unity and on AR devices.
